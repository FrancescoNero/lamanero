== Getting Started

1. After cloning the repo, run "bundle install" in the top folder to get all of the required libraries

2. Start server with "rails s"

3. Go to localhost:3000

== Notes
Imagemagick is used by the application. Ensure your system has it installed and available on the PATH. Obviously a ruby on rails environment is also required. Tested on ruby 2.0.0 and rails 4.0.2. To access the administration page go to /admins.
